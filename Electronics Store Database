# For this project, I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store

#1 Show Customers who are not in the US

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE Country= "Brazil";

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId,invoices.InvoiceDate,invoices.BillingCountry
FROM customers
JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.InvoiceId
WHERE BillingCountry= "Brazil";

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Support Agents

SELECT*
FROM employees
WHERE title= "Sales Support Agent";

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry asc;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;
