#This project involves a Store Database table of my own creation, and utilizes said data:

CREATE TABLE clothing_store (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER, color TEXT);
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (1, "shirts", 16, 8, "red");
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (2, "pants", 30, 10, "blue");
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (3, "dresses", 45, 15, "green");

#Show all the columns and order the items by price.
SELECT * 
FROM clothing_store 
ORDER BY price;

#Show the number of dresses that are in stock.
SELECT item, quantity
FROM clothing_store
WHERE item = 'dresses';

#Show which item is the cheapest.
SELECT MIN(price), item
